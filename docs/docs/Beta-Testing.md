# Beta Testing

New beta releases are always announced on the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/VngwVHJQg5) a week before the expected launch.

To beta-test the plugin, you can follow the steps below:

1. Set up a test vault. It is not recommended to use your main vault for this, however, you can copy your main one so you have a real representation of your setup for testing.
1. Install the [BRAT](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian42-brat) (Beta Reviewer's Auto-update Tool for Obsidian) plugin
1. Open the BRAT plugin options and click `add beta plugin`, enter this url: `https://github.com/jonjampen/obsidian-xournalpp`, and select `Latest version`.
1. Test if everything works as expected.
1. To report problems with the beta release, you can create an issue on GitHub directly or join the Discord Server, activate beta testing for your account in the #welcome channel and send me a message in the #beta-testing channel.

Thank you to anyone testing the plugin!
