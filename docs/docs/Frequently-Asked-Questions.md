# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### How can I annotate a PDF?

Currently, it is not possible, to open a PDF in Xournal++ as a background (for annotation). I'm waiting for Xournal++ to include a required feature in their official release, for this to be possible.

Until then the recommended way is to open the PDF (e.g. `myFile.pdf`) in Xournal++ (maybe through the system file explorer), go to `Save as` and add `_annotated` to the file name (e.g. `myFile_annotated.xopp`). The plugin will then export it to PDF (`myFile_annotated.pdf`) and there will be no naming conflicts.

### I have questions, issues, or ideas regarding the plugin, how can I get in touch?

If you have a specific bug report or feature request, you can open a new [issue](https://github.com/jonjampen/obsidian-xournalpp/issues). Otherwise, the easiest way is to join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/VngwVHJQg5) and send me a message.
